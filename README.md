Working title. WIP Clojure dialect for music composition. Currently interpreted, 
REPL only. Planning to extend to a desktop/terminal and browser app once more stable.

Rough at the moment, many things are likely to change, but core functionality is 
largely present.

Running requires Rust to be installed. `git clone` and then `cargo run` to open 
a REPL CLI. Add the flag `--release` to optimize build for speed and size.
